  Netflix Clone Built Using HTML & CSS
</h1>

<p><font size="3">
  This is a simple clone of the Netflix website built using <strong><em>HTML</em></strong> and <strong><em>CSS</em></strong>. It is a frontend project aimed at replicating the UI design of Netflix with a responsive and clean layout. While it does not have all the functionalities of the original Netflix, it showcases my ability to build a well-structured and styled website using HTML and CSS. The project includes the home page with a Netflix-like design.
